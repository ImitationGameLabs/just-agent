//! Liveness reconciliation: a slow background sweep that announces the moment
//! a running instance dies.
//!
//! The wire answers (`list`/`health`) already re-scan the tree on every call,
//! so the panel's view is always fresh; what the tree cannot do is *speak* —
//! nothing notices a Running→Dead transition unless someone happens to poll.
//! This loop is that watcher: it keeps its own previous-tick snapshot (the
//! daemon proper stays stateless — the tree remains the only truth), and on
//! one scan cycle's Running→Dead edge it emits a warn line carrying slug and
//! pid. Restarting the daemon resets the snapshot: the first tick after boot
//! observes without alerting, so pre-existing corpses don't fire.
